1 Introduction
**************

GNU Gama is a project dedicated to adjustment of geodetic networks.  It
is intended for use with traditional geodetic surveyings which are
still used and needed in special measurements (e.g., underground or
high precision engineering measurements) where the Global Positioning
System (GPS) cannot be used.

   In general, surveying is the technique and science of accurately
determining the terrestrial or three-dimensional spatial position of
points and the distances and angles between them.(1)

   Adjustment is a technical term traditionally used by geodesists and
surveyors which simply means "application of the least squares method to
process the over-determined system of measurements" (statistical
methods other than least squares are used sometimes but are not
common). In other words, we have more observations than needed and we
are trying to get the best estimate for adjusted observations and/or
coordinates.

   "Adjustment of geodetic networks" means that we have a set of points
with given coordinates coordinates of some points and a set of
observations among them. What is typical of adjustment of special
geodetic measurements is that the resulting linearised system might be
singular (we can have a network with no fixed points) and we are not
only interested in the values of `adjusted parameters and observations'
but also in the estimates of their covariances. This is what Gama does.

   Gama was originally inspired by Fortran system Geodet/PC (1990)
designed by Frantisek Charamza. The GNU Gama project started at the
department of mapping and cartography, faculty of Civil Engineering,
Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU) about 1998 and its name is
an acronym for _geodesy and mapping_.  It was presented to a wider
public for the first time at FIG Working Week 2000 in Prague and then
at FIG Workshop and Seminar at HUT Helsinki in 2001.

   The GNU Gama home page is

                  `http://www.gnu.org/software/gama/'

and the project is hosted on

               `http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group=gama'

   GNU Gama is released under the GNU General Public Licence and is
based on a C++ library of geodetic classes and functions and a small C++
template matrix library `matvec'. For parsing XML documents GNU Gama
calls the `expat' parser version 1.1, written by James Clark. The
`expat' parser is not part of the GNU Gama project, and is simply used
by GNU Gama.

   Adjustment in local Cartesian coordinate systems is fully supported
by a command-line program `gama-local' that adjusts geodetic (free)
networks of observed distances, directions, angles, height differences,
3D vectors and observed coordinates (coordinates with given
variance-covariance matrix).  Adjustment in global coordinate systems
is supported only partly as a `gama-g3' program.

1.3 Program `gama-local'
========================

Program `gama-local' is a simple command line tool for adjustment of
geodetic _free networks._ It is available for GNU Linux (the main
platform on which project GNU Gama is being developped) or for MS
Windows (tested with Borland compiler from Borland free command line
tools and with Microsoft Visual C++ compiler; support for Windows
platform is currently limited to maintaing compatibility with the two
mentioned compilers).

   Program `gama-local' reads input data in XML format (*note XML input
data format for gama-local::) and prints adjustment results into ASCII
text file. If output file name is not given, input file name with
extension`.txt' is used.  If run without arguments `gama-local' prints
a short help


     $ ./gama-local

     Adjustment of local geodetic network        version: 1.9.07 / GNU g++
     ************************************
     http://www.gnu.org/software/gama/

     Usage: gama-local  input.xml  [options]

     Options:

     --algorithm  svd | gso | cholesky
     --language   en | ca | cz | du | fi | fr | hu | ru | ua
     --encoding   utf-8 | iso-8859-2 | iso-8859-2-flat | cp-1250 | cp-1251
     --angles     400 | 360
     --latitude   <latitude>
     --ellipsoid  <ellipsoid name>
     --text       adjustment_results.txt
     --xml        adjustment_results.xml
     --cov-band   covariance matrix of adjusted parameters in XML output
                  n  = -1  for full covariance matrix (implicit value)
                  n >=  0  covariances are computed only for bandwidth n
     --version
     --help

Program `gama-local' version is followed by information on compiler
used to build the program (apart from GNU `g++' compiler, two other
possibilities are `bcc' and `msc' for Borland and Microsoft compilers
respectively, when build under Microsoft Windows).

   Option `--algorithm' enables to select numerical method used for
solution of the adjustment. Implicitly is used Singular Value
Decomposition (`svd'), alternatively user can decide for block matrix
algorithm GSO by Frantisek Charamza, based on Gram-Schmidt
ortogonalization. In both these cases, project equations are solved
directly without forming _normal equations_.  Third possibility is to
select Cholesky decomposition of semidefinite matrix of normal
equations (`cholesky').

   Option `--language' selects language used in output protocol. For
example, if run with option `--language cz', `gama-local' prints output
results in Czech languague using UTF-8 encoding. Implicit value is `en'
for output in English.

   Option `--encoding' enables to change inplicit UTF-8 output encoding
to iso-8859-2 (latin-2), iso-8859-2-flat (latin-2 without diacritics),
cp-1250 (MS-EE encoding) cp-12251 (Russian encoding).

   Option `--angles' selects angular units to be used in output.

   Options `--latitude' and/or `--ellipsoid' are used when observed
vertical and/or zenith angles need to be transfromed into the
projection plane. If none of theese two options is explicitly used, no
corrections are added to horizontal and/or zenith angles. If only one
of these options is used, then implicit value for `--latitude' is 45
degrees (50 gons) and implicit ellipsoid is WGS84.  Mathematical
formulas for the corrections is given in the following section.

   Adjustment results (`--text' and `--xml') can be redirected to
standard output if instead of a file name is used "-" string. If no
output is given, XML adjustment format is implicitly send to standard
output.

   Option `--cov-band' is used to reduce the number of computed
covariances (cofactors) in XML adjustment output. Implicitly full
matrix is written to XML output, which could degrade time eficiency for
the `envelope' algorithm for sparse matrix solution. Explicit option
for full covariance matrix is `--cov-band -1', option `--cov-band 0'
means that only a diagonal of covariance matrix is written to XML
output, `--cov-band 1' results in computing the main diagonal and first
codiagonal etc. If higher rank is specified then available, it si
reduced do maximum possible value `dim-1'.

1.3.1 Reductions of horizontal and zenith angles
------------------------------------------------

For evaluating of reductions of horizontal and zenith angles,
`gama-local' computes a helper point P_1 in the center of the network.
Horizontal and zenith angles observed at point P_2 are transformed to
the projection plane perpendicular to the normal z_1 of the helper
point P_1. Coordinates (x_2, y_2) of point P_2 are conserved, but its
normal z_2 is rotated by the central angle 2\gamma_12 to be parallel
with z_1.

   Formulas for reductions of horizontal and zenith angles are given
only in the printed version.

2 XML input data format for `gama-local'
****************************************

The input data format for a local geodetic network adjustment (program
`gama-local') is defined in accordance with the definition of Extended
Markup Language (XML) for description of structured data.  The XML
definition can be found at

                    `http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml'

Input data (points, observations and other related information) are
described using XML start-end pair tags `<xxx>' and `</xxx>' and
empty-element tags `<xxx/>'. The syntax of XML input format is defined
in the Document Type Definition (DTD) at

           `http://www.gnu.org/software/gama/gama-local.dtd'

and can formally be validated independently on the program `gama-local'.

   For parsing the XML input data, `gama-local' uses the XML parser
`Expat' copyrighted by James Clark which is described at

                `http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html'

`Expat' is subject to the Mozilla Public License (MPL), or may
alternatively be used under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
instead.

   In the `gama-local' XML input, distances are given in meters,
angular values in centigrades and their standard deviations (rms
errors) in millimetres or centigrade seconds, respectively.
Alternatively angular values in `gama-local' XML input can be given in
degrees and seconds (*note Angular units::).  At the end of this
document an example of the `gama-local' XML input data object is given.

File: gama.info,  Node: Angular units,  Next: Prolog,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.1 Angular units
=================

Horizontal angles, directions and zenith angles in `gama-local' XML
adjustment input are implicitly given in gons and their standard
deviations and/or variances in centicentigons.  Gon, also called
centesimal grade and Neugrad (German for new grad), is 1/400-th of the
circumference. For example

      <direction  from="202" to="416" val="63.9347"  stdev="10.0" />

The same angular value (direction) can be expressed in degrees as

      <direction  from="202" to="416" val="57-32-28.428"  stdev="3.24" />

In XML adjustment input degrees are coded as a single string, where
degrees (57), minutes (32) and seconds (28.428) are separated by dashes
(-) with optional leading sign. Spaces are not allowed inside the
string. Gons and degrees may be mixed in a single XML document but one
should be careful to supply the information on standard deviations
and/or covariances in the proper corresponding units.

Internaly `gama-local' works with gons but output can be transformed to
degrees using the option `--angles 360'.


File: gama.info,  Node: Prolog,  Next: Network definition,  Prev: Angular units,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.2 Prolog
==========

XML documents may, and should, begin with an XML declaration that
specifies the version of XML being used (_prolog_).  In the case of
`gama-local', the XML input data are followed by the XML document type
declaration:

     <?xml version="1.0" ?>
     <!DOCTYPE gama-local
       SYSTEM "http://www.gnu.org/software/gama/gama-local.dtd">


File: gama.info,  Node: Network definition,  Next: Network description,  Prev: Prolog,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.3 Tags `<gama-local>' and `<network>'
=======================================

A pair tag `<gama-local>' contains a single pair tag `<network>' that
contains the network definition.  The definition of the network is
composed of three sections:

   * `<description>' of the network (annotation or comments),

   * network `<parameters />' and

   * `<points-observations>' section.

The sections `<description>' and `<parameters />' are optional, the
section `<points-observations>' is mandatory.  These three sections may
be presented in any order and may be repeated several times (in such a
case, the corresponding sections are linked together by the software).

The pair tag `<network>' has two optional attributes `axes-xy' and
`angles'. These attributes are used to describe orientation of the `xy'
orthogonal coordinate system axes and the orientation of the observed
angles and/or directions.

   * `axes-xy="ne"' orientation of axes `x' and `y'; value `ne' implies
     that axis `x' is oriented north and axis `y' is oriented east.
     Acceptable values are `ne', `sw', `es', `wn' for left-handed
     coordinate systems and `en', `nw', `se', `ws' for right-handed
     coordinate systems (default value is `ne').

   * `angles="right-handed"' defines counterclockwise observed angles
     and/or directions, value `left-handed' defines clockwise observed
     angles and/or directions (default value is `right-handed').


Many geodetic systems are right handed with `x' axis oriented east, `y'
axis oriented north and counterclockwise angular observations. Example
of left-handed orthogonal system with different axes orientation is
coordinate system _Krovak_ used in the Czech Republic where the axes
`x' and `y' are oriented south and west respectively.

GNU Gama can adjust any combination of coordinate and angular systems.

Example
=======

     <gama-local>
     <network>
        <description> ... </description>
        <parameters ... />
        <points-observations> ... </points-observations>
     </network>
     </gama-local>

It is planned in future versions of the program to allow more
`<network>' tags (analysis of deformations etc.) and definitions of new
tags.


File: gama.info,  Node: Network description,  Next: Network parameters,  Prev: Network definition,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.4 Network description
=======================

The description of a geodetic network is enclosed in the start-end pair
tags `<description>'.  Text of the description is copied into the
adjustment output and serves for easier identification of results.  The
text is not interpreted by the program, but it may be helpful for users.

Example
=======

     <description>
     A short description of a geodetic network ...
     </description>


File: gama.info,  Node: Network parameters,  Next: Points and observations,  Prev: Network description,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.5 Network parameters
======================

The network parameters may be listed with the following optional
attributes of an empty-element tag `<parameters />'

   * `sigma-apr = "10"'       value of a priori reference standard
     deviation--square root of reference variance (default value 10)

   * `conf-pr = "0.95"'       confidence probability used in statistical
     tests (dafault value 0.95)

   * `tol-abs = "1000"'       tollerance for identification of gross
     absolute terms in project equations (default value 1000 mm)

   * `sigma-act = "aposteriori"'  actual type of reference standard
     deviation use in statistical tests (`aposteriori | apriori');
     default value is `aposteriori'

   * `update-constrained-coordinates = "no"' enables user to control if
     coordinates of constrained points are updated in iterative
     adjustment. If test on linerarization fails (*note
     Linearization::), Gama tries to improve approximate coordinates of
     adjusted points and repeats the whole adjustment. Coordinates of
     constrained points are implicitly not changed during iterations.

Values of the attributes must be given either in the double-quotes
(`"..."') or in the single quotes (`'...'').  There can be _white
spaces_ (spaces, tabs and new-line characters) between attribute names,
values, and the _equal_ sign.

Example
=======

     <parameters sigma-apr = "15"
                 conf-pr   = '0.90'
                 sigma-act = "apriori"
                 update-constrained-coordinates = "no" />


File: gama.info,  Node: Points and observations,  Next: Points,  Prev: Network parameters,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.6 Points and observations
===========================

The points and observations section is bounded by the pair tag
`<points-observations>' and contains information about points, observed
horizontal directions, angles, and horizontal distances, height
differences, slope distances, zenith angles, observed vectors and
control coordinates.

Optional attributes of the start tag `<points-observations>' allow for
the definition of default values of standard deviations corresponding
to observed directions, angles, and distances.

   * `direction-stdev = "..."' defines the implicit value of observed
     direction (default value is not defined)

   * `angle-stdev = "..."' defines the implicit value of observed angle
     (default value is not defined)

   * `zenith-angle-stdev = "..."' defines the implicit value of
     observed zenith angle (default value is not defined)

   * `distance-stdev = "..."' defines the implicit value of observed
     horizontal distance (default value is not defined)

Implicit values of standard deviations for the observed distances are
calculated from the model with three constants _a_, _b_, and _c_
according to the formula

                               a + bD^c,

where _a_ is a constant part of the model and _D_ is the observed
distance in kilometres. If the constants _b_ and/or _c_ are not given,
default values _b=0_ and _c=1_ will be used.

Example
=======

     <points-observations direction-stdev = "10"
                          distance-stdev  = "5 3 1" >
        <!-- ... points and observation data ... -->
     </points-observations>


File: gama.info,  Node: Points,  Next: Set of observations,  Prev: Points and observations,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.7 Points
==========

Points are described by the empty-element tags `<point/>' with the
following attributes:

   * `id = "..."' is the  point identification attribute (mandatory);
     point identification is not limited to _numbers_; all printable
     characters can be used in identification.

   * `x = "..."'    specifies coordinate `x'

   * `y = "..."'    specifies coordinate `y'

   * `z = "..."'    specifies coordinate `z', point height

   * `fix = "..."'  specifies coordinates that are fixed in adjustment;
     acceptable values are `xy', `XY', `z', `Z', `xyz', `XYZ', `xyZ'
     and `XYz'.

   * `adj = "..."'  specifies coordinates to be adjusted (unknown
     parameters in adjustment); acceptable values are `xy', `XY', `z',
     `Z', `xyz', `XYZ', `xyZ' and `XYz'.

With exception of the first attribute (point id), all other attributes
are optional.  Decimal numbers can be used as needed.

Control coordinates marked using the `fix' parameter are not changed in
the adjustment. Uppercase and lowercase notation of coordinates with
the `fix' parameter are interpreted the same.  Corrections are applied
to the unknown parameters identified by coordinates written in
lowercase characters given in the `adj' parameter. When the coordinates
are written using uppercase, they are interpreted as _constrained
coordinates._ If coordinates are marked with both the `fix' and `adj',
the `fix' parameter will take precedence.

_Constrained coordinates_ are used for the regularization of free
networks. If the network is not free (fixed network), the _constrained_
coordinates are interpreted as other unknown parameters.  In classical
free networks, the _constrained_ points define the regularization
constraint

                      \sum dx^2_i+dy^2_i = \min.

where _dx_ and _dy_ are adjusted coordinate corrections and the
summation index _i_ goes over all _constrained_ points.  In other
words, the set of the _constrained_ points defines the adjustment of
the free network (its shape and size) with a simultaneous
transformation to the approximate coordinates of selected points.
Program `gama-local' allows the definition of constrained coordinates
with 1D leveling networks, 2D and 3D local networks.

Example
=======

     <point id="1" y="644498.590" x="1054980.484" fix="xy"  />
     <point id="2" y="643654.101" x="1054933.801" adj="XY" />
     <point id="403" adj="xy" />


File: gama.info,  Node: Set of observations,  Next: Directions,  Prev: Points,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.8 Set of observations
=======================

The pair tag `<obs>' groups together a set of observations which are
somehow related. A typical example is a set of directions and distances
observed from one stand-point. An observation section contains a set of

   * horizontal directions  `<direction ... />'

   * horizontal distances   `<distance ... />'

   * horizontal angles      `<angle ... />'

   * slope distances        `<s-distance ...  />'

   * zenith angles          `<z-angle ... />'

   * height differences     `<dh />'

The band variance-covariance matrix of directions, distances, and angles
listed in one `<obs>' section may be supplied using a `<cov-mat>' pair
tag with attributes `dim' (dimension) and `band' (bandwidth). The
band-width of the diagonal matrix is equal to 0 and a fully-populated
variance-covariance matrix has a bandwidth of `dim-1'.

Observation variances and covariances (i.e. an upper-symmetric part of
the band-matrix) are written row by row between `<cov-mat>' and
`</cov-mat>' tags. If present, the dimension of the variance-covariance
matrix must agree with the number of observations.

The following example of variance-covariance matrix with dimension 6 and
bandwidth 2 (two nonzero codiagonals and three zero codiagonals)

     [ 1.1  0.1  0.2   0    0    0
       0.1  1.2  0.3  0.4   0    0
       0.2  0.3  1.3  0.5  0.6   0
        0   0.4  0.5  1.4  0.7  0.8
        0    0   0.6  0.7  1.5  0.9
        0    0    0   0.8  0.9  1.6 ]

is coded in XML as

     <cov-mat dim="6" band="2">
        1.1  0.1  0.2
             1.2  0.3  0.4

If two or more sets of directions with different orientations are
observed from a stand-point, they must be placed in different `<obs>'
sections. The value of an orientation angle can be explicitly stated
with an attribute `orientation="..."'.  Normally, it is more convenient
to let the program calculate approximate values of orientations needed
for the adjustment. If directions are present, then the attribute
`station' must be defined.

Optional attribute `from_dh="..."' enables to enter implicit height of
instrument for all observations within the `<obs>' pair tag.

Observed distances are expressed in meters, their standard deviations in
millimeters. Observed directions and angles are expressed in centigrades
(400) and their standard deviations in centigrade seconds.

Height differences can be entered in the `<obs>' or
`<height-differences>' section. If entered in the `<obs>' section, the
`dist="..."' parameter is ignored (*note Height differences::).

Example
=======

     <obs from="418">
        <direction  to=  "2" val="0.0000"   stdev="10.0" />
        <direction  to="416" val="63.9347"  stdev="10.0" />
        <direction  to="420" val="336.3190" stdev="10.0" />
        <distance   to="420" val="246.594"  stdev="5.0"  />
     </obs>

     <obs from="418">
        <direction  to=  "2" val="0.0000"   />
        <direction  to="416" val="63.9347"  />

2.9 Directions
==============

Directions are expressed with the following attributes in an
empty-element tag `<direction />'

   * `to = "..."'      target point identification

   * `val = "..."'     observed direction;  *note Angular units::

   * `stdev = "..."'   standard deviation (optional)

   * `from_dh = "..."' instrument height (optional)

   * `to_dh = "..."'   reflector/target height (optional)


The standard deviation is an optional attribute. However since all
observations in the adjustment must have their weights defined, the
standard deviation must be given either explicitly with the attribute
`stdev="..."' or implicitly with `<points-observation
direction-stdev="..." >' or with a variance-covariance matrix for the
given observation set.  A similar approach applies to all the
observations (distances, angles, etc.)

Example
=======

     <direction  to=  "2" val="0.0000"  stdev="10.0" />
     <direction  to="416" val="63.9347" />


File: gama.info,  Node: Horizontal distances,  Next: Angles,  Prev: Directions,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.10 Horizontal distances
=========================

Distances are written using an empty-element tag `<distance />' with
attributes

   * `from = "..."'    standpoint identification

   * `to = "..."'      target identification

   * `val = "..."'     observed horizontal distance

   * `stdev = "..."'   standard deviation of observed horizontal
     distance (optional)

   * `from_dh = "..."' instrument height (optional)

   * `to_dh = "..."'   reflector/target height (optional)


Contrary to directions,  distances in an observation set (`<obs>') do
not need to share a common stand-point. An example is set of distances
observed from several stand-points with a common variance-covariance
matrix.

Example
=======

     <distance from = "2"  to = "1" val = "659.184" />
     <distance to ="422" val="228.207"  stdev="5.0"  />
     <distance to ="408" val="568.341" />


File: gama.info,  Node: Angles,  Next: Slope distances,  Prev: Horizontal distances,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.11 Angles
===========

Observed angles are expressed with the following attributes of an
empty-element tag `<angle />'

   * `from = "..."'    standpoint identification (optional)

   * `bs = "..."'      backsight target identification

   * `fs = "..."'      foresight target identification

   * `val = "..."'     observed angle;  *note Angular units::

   * `stdev = "..." '  standard deviation (optional)

   * `from_dh = "..."' instrument height (optional)

   * `bs_dh = "..."'   backsight reflector/target height (optional)

   * `fs_dh = "..."'   foresight reflector/target height (optional)


Similar to distance observations, one observation set may group angles
observed from several standpoints.

Example
=======

     <angle from="433" bs="422" fs="402" val="128.6548" stdev="14.1"/>
     <angle from="433" bs="422" fs="402" val="128.6548" />
     <angle bs="422" fs="402" val="128.6548" stdev="14.1"/>
     <angle bs="422" fs="402" val="128.6548"/>


File: gama.info,  Node: Slope distances,  Next: Zenith angles,  Prev: Angles,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.12 Slope distances
====================

Slope distances (space distances) are written using an empty-element tag
`<s-distance />' with attributes

   * `from = "..."'   standpoint identification (optional)

   * `to = "..."'     target identification

   * `val = "..."'    observed slope distance

   * `stdev = "..."'  standard deviation of observed slope distance
     (optional)

   * `from_dh = "..."' instrument height (optional)

   * `to_dh = "..."'   reflector/target height (optional)


Similar to horizontal distances, one observation set may group slope
distances observed from several standpoints.

Example
=======

     <s-distance from = "2"  to = "1" val = "658.824" />
     <s-distance to ="422" val="648.618"  stdev="5.0"  />
     <s-distance to ="408" val="482.578" />


File: gama.info,  Node: Zenith angles,  Next: Height differences,  Prev: Slope distances,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.13 Zenith angles
==================

Zenith angles are written using an empty-element tag `<z-angle />' with
the following attributes

   * `from = "..."'   standpoint identification (optional)

   * `to = "..."'     target identification

   * `val = "..."'    observed zenith angle; *note Angular units::

   * `stdev = "..."'  standard deviation of observed zenith angle
     (optional)

   * `from_dh = "..."' instrument height (optional)

   * `to_dh = "..."'   reflector/target height (optional)


Similar to horizontal distances, one observation set may group zenith
angles observed from several standpoints.

Example
=======

     <z-angle from = "2"  to = "1" val = "79.6548" />
     <z-angle to ="422" val="85.4890"  stdev="5.0"  />
     <z-angle to ="408" val="95.7319" />


File: gama.info,  Node: Height differences,  Next: Control coordinates,  Prev: Zenith angles,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.14 Height differences
=======================

A set of observed leveling height differences is described using the
start-end tag `<height-differences>' without parameters.  The
`<height-differences>' tag can contain a series of height differences
(at least one) and can optionally be supplied with a
variance-covariance matrix.  Single height differences are defined with
empty tags `<dh />' having the following attributes:
   * `from  = "..."'  standpoint identification

   * `to    = "..."'  target identification

   * `val   = "..."'  observed leveling height difference

   * `stdev = "..."'  standard deviation of levellin elevation and

   * `dist  = "..."'  distance of leveling section (in kilometers)

If the value of standard deviation is not present and length of
leveling section (in kilometres) is defined, the value of standard
deviation is computed from the formula

                         m_dh = m_0 sqrt(D_km)
If the value of standard deviation of the height difference is defined,
information on leveling section length is ignored.  A third possibility
is to define a common variance-covariance matrix for all elevations in
the set.

Example
=======

     <height-differences>
       <dh from="A" to="B" val=" 25.42" dist="18.1" />
       <dh from="B" to="C" val=" 10.34" dist=" 9.4" />
       <dh from="C" to="A" val="-35.20" dist="14.2" />
       <dh from="B" to="D" val="-15.54" dist="17.6" />
       <dh from="D" to="E" val=" 21.32" dist="13.5" />
       <dh from="E" to="C" val="  4.82" dist=" 9.9" />
       <dh from="E" to="A" val="-31.02" dist="13.8" />
       <dh from="C" to="D" val="-26.11" dist="14.0" />
     </height-differences>


File: gama.info,  Node: Control coordinates,  Next: Coordinate differences,  Prev: Height differences,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.15 Control coordinates
========================

Control (known) coordinates are described by the start-end pair tag
`<coordinates>'. A series of points with known coordinates can be
defined using the `<point />' tag. The variance-covariance matrix for
the entire set of points can be created with a single `<cov-mat>' tag.
In the `<point />' tags, a point identification (ID) and its
coordinates (x, y and z) must be listed.  Although the order of the
`<point />' tag attributes is irrelevant in the corresponding
variance-covariance matrix, the expected order of the coordinates is x,
y and z (the horizontal coordinates x, y, or the height z might be
missing, but not both). The type of the points may be defined either
directly within the `<coordinates>' tag or outside of it.

Example
=======

     <coordinates>
        <point id="1" x="100.00" y="100.00" />
        <point id="2" z="200.00" y="200.00" x="200.00" />
        <point id="3" z="300.00" />
        <cov-mat dim="6" band="5" >
            ...  <!-- covariances for 1x 1y 2x 2y 2z 3z -->
        </cov-mat>
     </coordinates>


File: gama.info,  Node: Coordinate differences,  Next: Example,  Prev: Control coordinates,  Up: XML input data format for gama-local

2.16 Coordinate differences (vectors)
=====================================

Observed coordinate differences describe relative positions of station
pairs (vectors). Contrary to the observed coordinates, the
variance-covariance matrix of the coordinate differences always
describes all three elements of the 3D vectors.

Optional attributes of empty element tag `<vec>' for describing
instrument and/or target height are

   * `from_dh = "..."' instrument height

   * `to_dh = "..."'   target height

Example
=======

     <vectors>
        <vec from="id1" to="id2" dx="..." dy="..." dz="..." />
        <vec from="id2" to="id3" dx="..." dy="..." dz="..." />
        ...
        <cov-mat dim="..." band="..." >
            ..
        </cov-mat>
     </vectors>

3 Network adjustment with `gama-local'
**************************************

Adjustment of local geodetic network is a classical case of _adjustment
of indirect observations._  After estimation of approximate values of
unknown parameters (coordinates of points) and linearization of
functions describing relations between observations and parameters we
solve linear system of equations

     (1)      Ax = b + v,

where `A' is coefficient matrix, `b' is vector of absolute terms (right
hand side) and `v' is vector of residuals.  This system is (generally)
overdetermined and we seek the solution `x' satisfying the basic
criterion of Least Squares

     (2)      v'Pv = min,

where `P' is weight matrix. This criterion unambiguously defines the
shape of adjusted network.

In the case of _free network_ the system (1) is singular (matrix `A'
has linearly dependent columns) and we have to define second
regularization criterion

     (3)      \sum x_i^2 = min,      for all selected i

stating that at the same time we demand that the sum of squares
corrections of selected parameters is minimal (corrections of unknown
parameters with indexes from the set of all selected unknowns.
Geometrically this criterion is equivalent to adjustment of the network
according to (2) with simultaneous transformatin to the selected set of
fiducial points.  This transformation does not change the shape of
adjusted network.

Often it is advantageous to work with a _homogenized system,_ ie. with
the system of project equations in which coefficient of each row and
absolute term are multiplied by square root of the weight of
corresponding observation.

     (4)      ~A x = ~b,

where ~A = P^{1/2} A, ~b =  P^{1/2} A.  Symbol P^{1/2} denotes diagonal
matrix of square roots of observation weights (or Cholesky
decomposition of covariance matrix in the case of correlated
observations).  To criterion (2) corresponds in the case of homogenized
system criterion

     (5)      ~v'v = min.

3.1 Approximate coordinates
===========================

For computation of coefficients in system (1) (ie. during
linearization) we need, first of all, an estimate of approximate
coordinates of points and approximate values of orientations of observed
directions sets.

Approximate values of unknown parameters are usually not known and we
have to compute them from the available observations.  For approximate
value of orientation program `gama-local' uses median of all estimates
from the given set of directions to the points with known coordinates.
Median is less sensitive to outliers than arithmetic mean which is
normally used for approximate estimate of orientations

During the phase of computation of approximate coordinate of points,
program `gama-local' walks through the list of computed points and for
each point gathers all determining elements pointing to points with
known or previously computed coordinates.  Determining elements are

     *outer bearing*  (oriented half-line) starting from the point with
     known coordinates and pointing to the computed point

     *distance*       between given and computed points

     *inner angle*    with vertex in the computed point and arms
     intersecting given points


For all combinations of determining elements program `gama-local'
computes intersections and estimates approximate coordinates as the
median of all available solutions.

If at least one point was resolved while iterating through the list,
the whole cycle is repeated.

If no more coordinates can be solved using intersections and points with
unknown coordinates are remaining, program tries to compute coordinates
of unresolved points in a local coordinates system and obtain their
coordinates using similarity transformation. If a transformation
succeeds to resolve coordinates at least one computed point and there
are still some points without coordinates left, the whole process is
repeated.  Classes for computation of approximate coordinates have been
written by Jiri Vesely.

If program `gama-local' fails to compute approximate coordinates of
some of the network points, they are eliminated from the adjustment and
they are listed in the output listing.

With the outlined strategy, program `gama-local' is able to estimate
approximate coordinates in most of the cases we normally meet in
surveying profession. Still there are cases in which the solution fails.
One example is an inserted horizontal traverse with sets of observed
direction on both ends but without a connecting observed distance.  The
solution of approximate coordinates can fail when there is a number of
gross error for example resulting from confusion of point
identifications but in normal situations, leaving computation of
approximate coordinates on program `gama-local' is recommended.

3.2 Gross absolute terms
========================

One of parameters in XML input of program `gama-local' is tolerance
`tol-abs' for detecting of gross absolute terms in project equations.
Observations with outlying absolute terms are always excluded from
adjustment.

For measured distances program tests difference between observed value
d_i and distance computed from approximate coordinates d_0

              |d_i - d_0| > `tol-abs',

for observed directions program `gama-local' tests transverse deviation
corresponding to absolute term b_i from project equations (1)

              | b_i | d_0 > `tol-abs'

and similarly for angles, program tests the greater of two deviations
corresponding to left and right distances (left and right arm of the
angle)

              |b_i| max{ d_{0_l}, d_{0_r} }  > `tol-abs'.

Default value of parameter `tol-abs' is 1000 mm.

3.3 Parameters of statistical analysis
======================================

Program `gama-local' uses two basic statistical parameters

   * confidence probability P (default value is 95%, see parameter
     `conf-pr') and

   * actual type of reference standard deviation m0_a (parameter
     `typ-m0').

Confidence probability determines significance level on which
statistical tests of adjusted quatities are carried.  Actual type of
reference standard deviations m0_a specifies whether during statistical
analysis we use a priori reference standard deviation m0 or a
posteriori estimate m0'.

We can choose only the type of actual reference standard deviation (m0
or m0') but not its value. The value corresponds to a priori given
value of reference standard deviation or to the results of adjustment.
On the type of actual reference standard deviation depends the choice
of density functions of stochastic quantities in statistical analysis
of the adjustment.

     *A priori reference standard deviation m0* is used in the cases
     when we know its value in advance and with sufficient reliability.
     Another situation when m0 is used are networks with low number of
     degrees of freedom (poorly overdetermined systems) or when veen
     degrees of freedom is zero. Examples may be analysis of network
     models etc.

     *A posteri estimate of reference standard deviation m0'* is used
     in cases when a priori value of reference standard deviation m0 is
     not known and when degrees of freedom is sufficiently high and
     reliable for empirical estimate of m0'.

The standard deviantion of an adjusted quuantity is computed in
dependence of the choice of actual type of reference standard deviation
m0_a according to formula

                             m0_a sqrt(q)

where q is the weight coefficient of the corresponding adjusted unknown
parameter or observation. Apart from the standard deviation, program
`gama-local' computes for the adjusted quantity its _confidence
interval_ in which its real value is located with the probability P.

3.4 Test on the reference standard deviation
============================================

Null hypothesis H_0: m0 = m0' is tested versus alternative hypothesis
H_1: m0 ne m0'.  Test criterion is ratio of a posteriori estimate of
reference standard deviation

              m0' = sqrt( v'P v / r).

and a priori reference standard deviation m0 (input data parameter
`m0-apr'). For given significance level alpha lower and upper bounds of
interval (L, U) are computed so, that if hypothesis H_0 is true,
probabilities P(m0'/m0 le D) and P(m0'/m0 ge H) are equal to alpha/2.
Lower and upper bounds of the interval are computed as

              L = sqrt((Chi^2_{1-alpha/2,r})/r),
              U = sqrt((Chi^2_{ alpha/2 ,r})/r).

Probability

              P(L < m0'/m0 < U) = `conf-pr'

is by default 95%, this corresponds to 5% confidence level test.

Exceeding the upper limit H of the confidence interval can be caused
even by a single gross error (one outlying observation).  Method of
Least Squares is generally very sensitive to presence of outliers.
Safely can be detected only one observation whose elimination leads to
maximal decrease of a posteriori estimate of reference standard
deviation

     (6)      m0''  = sqrt{(v'P v - delta)/(r-1)},
              delta = max(v_i^2/q_vi),

where

     (7)      q_vi = 1/p_i - q_Li

is weight coefficient of i-th residual.  If the set of observations
contains only one gross error, the outlying observation is likely to be
detected, but this can not be guaranteed.

In addition, program `gama-local' computes a posteriori estimate of
reference standard deviation separately for horizontal distances and
directions and/or angles after formula from

              m0'_t = sqrt(sum{~v^2_it}) / sum{~q_vi}),    t=d,s,

where symbol t denotes observed distances, directions and/or angles.

     m0' empirical:     9.64         [pvv] : 3.43560e+03

     During statistical analysis we work

     - with empirical standard deviation 9.64
     - with confidence level             95 %

     Ratio m0' empirical / m0 apriori: 0.964

     m0'/m0 (distances): 0.997   m0'/m0 (directions): 0.943

     Maximal decrease of m0''/m0 on elimination of one observation: 0.892

3.5 Information on points
=========================

Program `gama-local' lists separately review of coordinates of fixed and
adjusted points; adjusted _constrained_ coordinates are marked with
`*'; see equation (3).  Adjusted coordinate standard deviations m_x and
m_y, and values for computing confidence intervals are given in the

For adjusted points, program summarizes information on standard
ellipses, confidence ellipses, mean square positional errors (m_p),
mean coordinate errors (m_xy) and coefficients g characterizing
position of approximate coordinates with regard to the confidence
ellipse.

Mean square positional error m_p and mean coordinate error (m_xy) are
computed as

              m_p = sqrt(m_y^2 + m_x^2),    m_xy = m_p / sqrt(2),

where m_y^2 and m_x^2 are squares of standard deviations (variances) of
adjusted points coordinates.

Semimajor and semiminor axes of standard ellipse are denoted as a and b
in the listing, bearing of semimajor axis is denoted as alpha and they
are computed from covariances of adjusted coordinates

              a = sqrt(1/2(cov_yy + cov_xx + c),
              b = sqrt(1/2(cov_yy + cov_xx - c),

              c = sqrt( (cov_xx - cov_yy)^2 + 4(cov_xy)^2 ),

              tan 2alpha = 2(cov_xy) / (cov_xx - cov_yy).

The angle alpha (the bearing of semimajor axis) is measured clockwise
from X axis.

Probability that standard ellipse covers real position of a point is
relatively low. For this reason program `gama-local' computes extra
_confidence ellipse_ for which the probability of covering real point
position is equal to the given confidence probability.  Both ellipsy
are located in the same center, they share the same bearing of
semimajor axes and they are similar.  For lengths of their semi-axis
holds

              a' = k_p a,        b' = k_p b,

where k_p is a coefficient computed for the given probability P as
defined in *note Statistical analysis::.

Position of  approximate coordinates of an adjusted point with respect
to its confidence ellipse are expressed by a coeeficient g Three cases
are possible

     g < 1 approximate coordinates of adjusted point are located inside
     the confidence ellipse

     g = 1 approximate coordinates of adjusted point are located on the
     confidence ellipse

     g > 1 approximate coordinates of adjusted point are outside the
     confidence ellipse

The coefficient g is calculated from formula

              g = sqrt( (a_0 / a')^2 + (b_0/b')^2 )

where

              b_0 = delta_y cos(alpha) - delta_x sin(alpha),
              a_0 = delta_y sin(alpha) - delta_x cos(alpha)

symbol delta is used for correction of approximate coordinates and
alpha is bearing of confidence ellipse semimajor axis.

If network contains sets of observed directions, program writes
information on corresponding adjusted orientations, standard deviations
and confidence intervals.  Index i is the same as in the case of
adjusted coordinates the index of i-th adjusted unknown in the project
equations.

observation, its approximate and adjusted value, standard deviation and
confidence interval.

Review of residuals serves for analysis of observations and containts
values of normalized or studentized residuals (depending on type of
m0_a used) and three characteristics.  Theese are coefficient `f'
identifying weak network elements and estimates of real error of
observation `e-obs' and real error of its adjusted value `e-adj', see
definition in the following text.

If normalized or studentized residual exceeds critical value for the
given confidence probability, it is marked in the review with symbol
`c' (critical) and maximal normalized or studentized residual is marked

3.7 Identification of weak network elements
===========================================

When planning observations in a geodetic network we always try to
guarantee that all observed elements are checked by other measurements.
Only with redundant measurements it is possible to adjust observations
and possibly remove blunders that might otherwise totaly corrupt the
whole set of measurements. Apart from sufficient number of redundant
observations the degree of control of single observed elements is given
by the network configuration, ie. its geometry.

Less controlled observations represent weak network elements and they
can in extreme cases even disable detection of gross observational
errors as it is in the case of uncontrolled observations.  There are
two limit cases of observation control

     *fully controlled observation* as is for example an observed
     distance between two fixed points (standard deviation of the
     adjusted element is zero; standard deviation of the residual
     equals to the standard deviation if the observation) and

     *uncontrolled observations* as is a free polar bar for example
     (standard deviation of adjusted value is equal to standard
     deviation of observed quantity; residual and standard deviation of
     the residual are zero).

Weakly controlled or uncontrolled observations can result even from
elimination of certain suspisios observations during analysis of
adjusment.

Standard deviation of adjusted observations is less than standard
deviation of the measurement.  Degree of observation control in network
is defined as coefficient

     (8)      f = 100 (m_l - m_L)/m_l,

where m_l is standard deviation of observed quantity and m_L is standard
deviation computed from a posteriori reference standard deviation m0.
We consider observed network element to be

     *uncontrolled* if f < 0.1 (in listing marked with letter `u'),

     *weakly controlled* if 0.1 le f < 5 (in listing marked with letter
     `w').

3.8 Estimation of real errors
=============================

Acording to previous section we can consider an observation to be
controlled if its coefficient f > 0.1.  Any controlled observation can
be eliminated from the network without corrupting the network
consistency--network reduced by one controlled observation can be
adjusted and all unknown parameters can be compute without the
eliminated observation.

Estimate of real error of i-th observation is defined as

     (9)      e_li = L^red_i - l_i,

where e_li is value of i-th observation and is value of i-th network
element computed from adjusted coordinates and/or orientations of the
reduced network.  Similarly is defined the estimate of real error of a
residual

     (10)     e_vi = L^red_i - L_l.

Adjustment results are the best statistical estimate of unknown
parameters that we have. This holds true even for adjustment of
_reduced_ network which is not influenced by real error of i-th
observation.  On favourable occasions differences (9) and (10) can help
to detect blunders but to interpret these estimates as _real errors_ is
possible only with substantial exaggeration.  These estimates fail when
there are more than one significant observational error. Generally
holds tha the weaker the element is controlled in netowrk the less
reliable these estimates are.

Estimate of real error of an observation computes program `gama-local'
as

              e_li = v_i/(p_i q_vi)

and estimate of real error of a residual as

              e_vi = e_li - v_i.

3.9 Test on linearization
=========================

Mathematical model of geodetic network adjustment in `gama-local' is
defined as a set of known real-valued differentiable functions

     (11)      L^* = f(X^*)

where L^* is a vector of theoretical correct observations and X^* is a
vector of correct values of parameters. For the given sample set of
observations `L' and the unknown vector of residuals `v' we can express
the estimate of parameters `X' as a nonlinear set of equations

     (12)      L + v = f(X).

With approximate values `X_0' of unknown parameters

     (12)      X = X_0 + x

we can linearize the equations (12)

               L + v = f(X_0) + f'(X_0)x.

yielding the linear set of equations (1)

Unknown parameters in `gama-local' mathematical model are points
coordinates and orientation angles (transforming observed directions to
bearings). The observables described by functions (12) belong into two
classes

     *linear observables*: horizontal and slope distances, height
     differences, control coordinates and vectors (coordinate
     differences),

     *angular observables*: directions, horizontal and zenith angles.

Internally in `gama-local' unknown corrections to linear observables
are computed in millimeters and corrections to angular observables in
centigrade seconds. To reflect the internal units in used all partial
derivatives of angular observables by coordinates are scaled by factor
2000/pi.

When computing coefficients of project equations (1) we expect that
approximate coordinates of points are known with sufficient accuracy
needed for linearization of generally nonlinear relations between
observations and unknown paramters. Most often this is true but not
always and generally we have to check how close our approximation is to
adjusted parameters.

Generally we check linearization in adjustment by double calculation of
residuals

              v^I  = Ax - b,
              v^II = ~l(~x) - l,


Program `gama-local' similarly computes and tests differences in values
of adjusted observations once computed from residuals and once from
adjusted coordinates. For measured directions and angles `gama-local'
computes in addition transverse deviation corresponding to computed
angle difference in the distance of target point (or the farther of two
targets for angle).  As a criterion of bad linearization is supposed
positional deviation greater or equal to 0.0005 millimetres.

From the practical point of view it might seem that the tolerance
0.0005 mm for detecting poor linearization is too strict.  Its
exceeding in program `gama-local' results in repeated adjustment with
substitute adjusted coordinates for approximate. Given tolerance was
chosen so strict to guarantee that listed output results would never be
influenced by linearization and could serve for verification and
testing of numerical solutions produced by other programs.

Implicitly coordinates of constrained points are not changed in
iterative adjustments. This feature can be changed in XML input data by
setting `<parameters update-constrained-coordinates = "yes" />' (*note
Network parameters::).

Iterated adjustement with successive improvement of approximate
coordinates converges usually even for gross errors in initial estimates
of unknown coordinates. If the influence of linearization is detected
after adjustment, quite often only one iteration is sufficient for
recovering.

For any automatically controlled iteration we have to set up certain
stopping criterion independent on the convergence and results obtained.
Program `gama-local' computes iterated adjustment three times at
maximum.  If the bad linearization is detected even after three
readjustments it signals that given network configuration is somehow
suspicious.

4.1 Observation data and points
===============================

The Gama observation data structures are designed to enable adjustment
of any combination of possibly correlated observations.  At its very
early stage Gama was limited to adjustment of uncorrelated
observations. Only directions and distances were available and
observable's weight was stored together with the observed value in a
single object. A single array of pointers to observation objects was
sufficient for handling all observations. So called _orientation
shifts_ corresponding to directions measured form a point were stored
together with coordinations in _point objects_.

 [image src="fig/obsdata-fig.png" text="[image: Schema of observation data structures]
" ]

To enable adjustment of possibly correlated observations (like angles
derived from observed directions or already adjusted coordinates from a
previous adjustment) Gama has come with the concept of _clusters_.
Cluster is an object with a common variance-covariance matrix and a
list of pointers to observation objects (distances, directions, angles,
etc.). Weights were removed from observation objects and replaced with
a pointer to the cluster to which the observation belong. All clusters
are joined in a common object `ObservationData'; similarly to
observations, each cluster contains a pointer to its parent
`Observation Data' object.  _Orientation shifts_ were separated from
coordinates and are stored in the cluster containing the bunch of
directions and thus number of orientations is not limited to one for a
point.

This organisation of observational information has proved to be
effective.  Template classes `ObservationData' and `Cluster' are used
as base classes both in `gama-local' and `gama-w3'


template <typename Observation>
  class ObservationData
  {
  public:
    ClusterList<Observation>  CL;

    ObservationData();
    ObservationData(const ObservationData& cod);
    ~ObservationData();

    ObservationData& operator=(const ObservationData& cod);
    template <typename P> void for_each(const P& p) const;
  };

template <typename Observation>
  class Cluster
  {
  public:
    const ObservationData<Observation>*  observation_data;
    ObservationList<Observation>         observation_list;
    GaMaLib::Cov                         covariance_matrix;

    Cluster(const ObservationData<Observation>* od);
    virtual ~Cluster();

    virtual Cluster* clone(const ObservationData<Observation>*) const = 0;
    double stdDev(int i) const;
    int size() const;
    void update();
    int  activeCount() const;
    GaMaLib::Cov  activeCov() const;
  };

The following template class `PointBase' for handling point information
is used in `gama-w3'. The template class `PointBase' relies internally
on `std::map' container but comes with its own interface (in
`gama-local' `std::map' was used directly for storing points).


template <typename Point>
  class PointBase
  {
    typedef std::map<typename Point::Name, Point*>  Points;

  public:
    PointBase();
    PointBase(const PointBase& cod);
    ~PointBase();

    PointBase& operator=(const PointBase& cod);
    void put(const Point&);
    void put(Point*);
    Point*       find(const typename Point::Name&);
    const Point* find(const typename Point::Name&) const;
    void erase(const typename Point::Name&);
    void erase();

    class const_iterator;
    const_iterator  begin();
    const_iterator  end  ();

    class iterator;
    iterator  begin();
    iterator  end  ();
  };

Template classes `ObservationData' and `PointBase' are defined in
namespace `GNU_gama' and are located in the source directory `gnu_gama'.

4.3 Transformation from spatial to geographical coordinates
===========================================================

Spatial coordinates (X, Y, Z) can be easily computed from geographical
ellipsoidal coordinates (B, L, H), where B is geographical latitude, L
geographical longitude and H is elliposidal height, as

     X = (N + H) cos B cos L
     Y = (N + H) cos B sin L
     Z = (N(1-e^2) + H)sin B

where N = a/sqrt(1 - e^2 sin^2 B) is the radius of curvature in the
prime vertical, e^2 = (a^2 - b^2)/a^2 is the first eccentricity for the
given rotational ellipsoid (spheroid) with semi-major axis a and
semi-minor axis b.

In the case of coordiante transformation from (X, Y, Z) to (B, L, H),
the longitude is given by the formula

     tan L = Y / X.

Now we can introduce

     D = sqrt(X^2 + Y^2),

so that the cartesian system become (D, Z).  Coordinates B and H are
then usually computed by iteration with some starting value of B_0, for
example

     tan B_0 = Z/D/(1 - e^2),

     tan B = Z/D + N/(N+H) e^2 tan B,   H  = D / cos B = Z / sin B - N(1-e^2)

B. R. Bowring described a closed formula(1) that is more effective and
sufficiantly accurate and that is used in GNU Gama.

 [image src="fig/xyz2blh-fig.png" text="[image: Spatial and geographical coordinates]


" ]

The centre of curvature C of the spheroid corresponding to P' is the
point

                  (e^2 a cos^3 u,  -e'^2 b sin^3 u)),

where e'^2 = (a^2 - b^2)/b^2 is second eccentricity and u is the
parametric latitude of the point P',  (1-e^2)N sin B = b sin u.
Therefore

          tan B = (Z + e'^2 b sin^3 u) / (D - e^2 a cos^3 u).
This is clearly an iterative solution; but it has been found that this
formula is extremely accurate using the single first approximation for
u for the tan u = (Z/D)(a/b).  Maximum error in earth bound region is
3e-8 of sexadecimal arc seconds (5e-7 millimetres); maximum is 0.0018"
(0.1 millimetres) at height H = 2a.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you".

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has less than five).

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and
          add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgments" or "Dedications",
          preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all
          the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgments and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
          conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgments", and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

A.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
